# AlgorithmicProblemSolving
Solutions from NYU CSCI-UA 480 past problem sets.

## Problem descriptions:

### Add:
  Output the sum of two input numbers -1,000,000 <= x, y <= 1,000,000.

### Add2:
  Output the sum of two input numbers withough size boundaries.
  
### Cars:
  Output the first month where the loan of a car is less than the worth of the car.
  The duration, down payment, and loan are given in the first line.
  The worth of the car begins as down + loan, and deprecates according to input values of the form "month, new deprecation rate".

### Fibonacci:
  Output the Nth value of a Fibonacci sequence such that 1 <= N <= 40 and F(1) == 1.

### Fibonacci2:
  Output the Nth value of a Fibonacci sequence such that 1 <= N <= 80 and F(1) == 0.

### RodSculpture:
  Output the direction of the tip of a rod following the given instructions.
  For points length-i to 1, the rod can be bent in these directions: +y, -y, +z, -z.
  The rod begins pointed toward the direction +x.

### BaseConversion:
  Check if a number is valid for a given base, and if so, convert it to another given base 2 <= bases 1, 2 <= 16 and output this number.
  
### ChessBracket:
  Output the total number of walkover games in a chess tournament given the expected number of players and the list of missing players.
  
### EndianReverse:
  Reverse the endian for a given integer in two's complement.
 
### EvenColumns:
  Output the minimum number of moves to level out a given number of columns of given heights.
  
### NegativeBase:
  Output the "negative base 2" conversion of a base 10 integer n.
  This is computed such that `n = b_0 + b_1 * (-2) + b+2 * (-2)^2 + b_3 * (-2)^3 + ...`
